    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>⅔ cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>¾ cup superfine sugar</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups self-rising flour</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, mix butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light
        and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Stir in the eggs, one at a time, blending
        well after each one. Stir in the vanilla and flour just until mixed.
        Spoon the batter into the prepared cups, dividing evenly.

        Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly
        pressed, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan set over a wire rack. When
        cool, arrange the cupcakes on a serving platter.
